Notes
-----
- Modules are going to be a bitch.
- REMEMBER TO USE sys/types.h!
- REMEMBER TO USE posk_malloc!
- Remember to use fragmented conf system!
- CHAR ARRAYS SUCKS!
- ignore everything above this line
- fuck nasm
- Testing this will be raw.
- NASM sucks fat dick
- using grub to make a floppy image and use qemu
- qemu has video render issues. avoid it
- bochs looks to be cools.
- to boot kernel in bochs run:
kernel 200+18
boot
- well, it boots!
- moving terminal stuff over to term.h / c
- holy christ x86 is fast. never forget that
- kern can't malloc. we need kmalloc, malloc will be userspace, and swap-able etc
- off to build kmalloc / kfree. shit. we'll have to allocate from the heap
- FUCK yes, I don't have to write sizeof
- #linux on irc.freenode is populated by total dickweeds. avoid it
- DOH. Remember to include GCC derivs in the makefile. Just spent hours debugging a phantom issue.
