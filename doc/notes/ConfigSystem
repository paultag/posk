This document outlines how the build system works
and how it has evolved over time. This is not offical
and it's only to keep one's self sane.

Notes
-----
- Makefile includes posk/configure/* ( PRT )
- Ensure conf dir is not empty ( PRT )
- Always append to KERNEL_CONFIG make var, Append with += ( PRT )
